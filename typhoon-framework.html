            <h4 class="sub-title">The brief</h4>

            <p>In order to be successful, projects with extensive scope require a careful application
                of software design patterns. One of these patterns is called Dependency Injection, and although it can
                be applied manually, in larger projects it helps to have a library to manage this. While such libraries
                existed for other platforms, there were limited options for iOS and OSX, so we set out to create such a
                library. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <h4 class="sub-title">The results</h4>

            <p>In the development of Typhoon we used the same comprehensive quality
                control tool-set that we use on our client projects. Each commit undergoes stringent checks such as code
                analysis, unit testing and coverage checking before being accepted. Typhoon became the leading framework
                for Dependency Injection in iOS and OSX, and is used to power
                thousands of apps world-wide, while simplifying their development and maintainability.</p>
